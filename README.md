## Rugs

### NewPythonLibraryProject

The `NewPythonLibraryProject` editor generates a new pure [Python][python] 
library package.

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this editor.

#### Parameters

To run this editor, you must supply the following parameters.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
`project_name` | Yes | |  A [PEP8][pep8] valid package name.  It must be 21 characters or less to avoid truncating name when the its Slack channel is created.
`version` | No | 0.1.0| [Semantic version][semver] of the project.
`description` | No | My new project | A brief description of the project.

[semver]: http://semver.org
[pep8]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:python-library:NewPythonLibraryProject \
    pet-shop-library \
    version=0.2.0 \
    description="A terrific new library"
```

Note the first parameter, the `project_name`, is different in that you
do not need to supply the name of the parameter, just the value.  This
is because the `project_name` parameter is required for all
editors that generate a project.  This will create a directory named 
`pet-shop-library` and populate it with a working Python library.  
If you are happy with the change, commit the changes.

```
$ cd pet-shop-library
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial version generated by Atomist'
```

See the README in the generated project for further instructions.

### AddChangeLog

The `AddChangeLog` editor adds a somewhat basic `CHANGELOG.md` file following
[common conventions][changelog].

[changelog]: http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this editor.

#### Parameters

To run this editor, you should supply the following parameter.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
`version` | No | 0.1.0| [Semantic version][semver] of the project.

[semver]: http://semver.org

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory/project-directory
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:python-library:AddChangeLog \
    version=0.2.0
```

### AddPythonGitignore

The `AddPythonGitignore` editor adds a default `.gitignore` file suitable
for Python projects.

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this editor.

#### Parameters

This editor has no parameters.

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory/project-directory
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:python-library:AddPythonGitignore
```

### AddTravisCI

The `AddTravisCI` editor adds a `.travis.yml` file to your project with a basic
layout for building a Python project. It installs the dependencies and runs your
tests as part of the build.

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this editor.

#### Parameters

This editor has no parameters.

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory/project-directory
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:python-library:AddTravisCI
```

## Support

General support questions should be discussed in the `#support`
channel on our community Slack team
at [atomist-community.slack.com][slack].

If you find a problem, please create an [issue][].

[issue]: https://github.com/atomist-rugs/python-library/issues

## Development

You can build, test, and install the project locally with
the [Rug CLI][cli].

[cli]: https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli

```
$ rug test
$ rug install
```

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  For example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will
automatically create a GitHub release using the tag name for the
release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as the contents
of the release notes.  It will also automatically upload the needed
artifacts.
