# Python library Rug generator and editors

This [rug archive](http://docs.atomist.com/) offers a generator, to create a 
Python package linrary project.

## Generate a Python library project

### From an online button

[<img src="https://images.atomist.com/button/create-project.png" width="267" alt="Get Started with Atomist"/>](https://api.atomist.com/v1/projects/generators/d6812a02-54e5-478c-b75a-214329f00a0e)

This will ask you to authorize the [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com/)
application in your GitHub organisation/account then will ask you to provide
a set of parameters to generate the Python library.

Once the project is generated in your GitHub organisation/account, simply
checkout the newly generated project and follow its README to get started.

### From the Atomist bot

From the [Atomist community slack team](https://join.atomist.com/), or if you 
have brought the Atomist bot to your own slack team, simply type 
```@atomist generators python-lib```. This will bring up the python library 
generator. You can either click on the button or type 
```@atomist create python-lib``` to start the workflow.

Once the project is generated in your GitHub organisation/account, simply
checkout the newly generated project and follow its README to get started.

###Â From the CLI

To generate a project on your local machine, install the 
[Rug CLI](http://docs.atomist.com/rug/rug-cli/) and run:

```
$ rug generate -X --repo --change-dir /tmp atomist-rugs:python-library:NewPythonLibraryProject myproj
```

This creates a directory `/tmp/myproj` where your Python libfrary can now 
be found. It also initializes that directory as a git repository.

## Edit a Python library project

You can now enhance your new project, or an existing one, by going through
editors.

### From the Atomist bot

From the [Atomist community slack team](https://join.atomist.com/), or if you 
have brought the Atomist bot to your own slack team, simply type 
```@atomist editors python-lib```. This will bring up the Python library 
editors.  You can click on the button for any listed editors.

### From the CLI

Using the Rug CLI, type the following:

```
$ rug describe editor atomist-rugs:python-library
```

This will list all available editors for a Python library project. For instance 
to  apply the `AddPythonGitignore` editor, run the next command:

```
$ rug edit -X --change-dir /tmp/myproj atomist-rugs:python-library:AddPythonGitignore
```

This will add the necessary files. You can now use git to review the changes and
commit them as you see fit. You could also have used the `--repo` flag for an
automatic commit done by the CLI.
